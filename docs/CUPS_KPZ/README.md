Points to make

- Deriving an equation for a complicated process likes this looks like a total cheat.

- Why do we study models like this, even though they are both unrealistic and hard to solve?

- Looks a bit like a complicated board game.

- Appearance of scale invariance is surprising, given that the original system is definitely not scale invariant
